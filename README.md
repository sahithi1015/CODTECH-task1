OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
Project:Exploratory data analysis on iris dataset
Objective:
The main objective of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset. EDA is crucial for understanding the underlying patterns, relationships, and anomalies in the data before applying any machine learning algorithms. Specifically, this project aims to:
*Understand the distribution of each feature in the dataset.
*Visualize relationships between different features.
*Identify and visualize any correlations between features.
*Detect and visualize outliers in the dataset.
Key Activities
1.Data Loading:
*Load the Iris dataset using sklearn.datasets.load_iris.
*Convert the dataset into a pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation and analysis.
2.Basic Data Exploration:
*Display the first few rows of the dataset to get an initial look at the data.
*Check for missing values to ensure data completeness.
*Generate summary statistics to understand the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the data's distribution.
3.Visualize Feature Distribution:
*Plot histograms for each feature to visualize their distributions and identify any skewness or unusual patterns.
4.Visualize Pairwise Relationships:
*Use pair plots to visualize relationships between pairs of features, colored by species, to understand how features interact with each other.
5.Correlation Analysis:
*Generate a heatmap to visualize the correlation between different features and identify any strong linear relationships.
6.Outlier Detection:
*Use box plots to detect and visualize outliers in each feature, categorized by species, to identify any unusual observations that might affect analysis.
Technologies Used
1.Python: The programming language used for data analysis and visualization.
2.Pandas: A powerful data manipulation library used to create and manipulate the DataFrame.
3.NumPy: A library for numerical operations, used here indirectly through pandas.
4.Seaborn: A statistical data visualization library used to create pair plots, heatmaps, and box plots.
5.Matplotlib: A plotting library used to create histograms and for additional plotting capabilities.
6.Scikit-Learn: A machine learning library used to load the Iris dataset.
7.Warnings: The warnings library is used to suppress any unnecessary warnings that may clutter the output.
